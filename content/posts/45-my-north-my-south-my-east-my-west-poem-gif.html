    <p><strong>45+ My North My South My East My West Poem Gif</strong>. He was my north, my south, my east and west, my working week and my sunday rest, my noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; He was my north, my south, my east and west, my working week and my sunday rest, my noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;</p>

                My road calls me, lures me west, east, south, and north; North, south, east, west or north, south, east, west. I assumed they were always capitalized because of this.
    </p>

    <h3>North, south, east, west or north, south, east, west.</h3>
    <p>Most roads lead men homewards, my road leads me forth. I thought that love would last forever: He was my north, my south, my east and west, my working week and my sunday rest. The stars are not wanted now:</p>
