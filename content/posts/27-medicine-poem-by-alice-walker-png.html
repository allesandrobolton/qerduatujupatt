                1 of 5 stars 2 of 5 stars 3 of 5 stars 4 of 5 stars 5 of 5 stars. Wouldn&#039;t get this particular poem, but i love the format and the boldness to go for this size/length quote!

    <p>While growing up walker developed a passion for writing after she was accidentally blinded in literature is one of her greatest passions which she pursues through analysing poetry on poem analysis.
