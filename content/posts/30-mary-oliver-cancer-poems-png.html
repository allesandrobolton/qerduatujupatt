                The joy that isn&#039;t shared, i&#039;ve heard, / dies young. Here is my audiobook of thirst and other poems by mary oliver. The winner of a pulitzer prize in 1984, she was loved for good reasons.

    <h3>He thought i&#039;d like her poems because she&#039;s such an independent woman, and he was right.</h3>
    <p>Thirst closes with an amazing epilogue (the title poem). And one more quote from a poem i think you will appreciate: Edna pickett&#039;s sophomore english class circa 1962. She is erotic, full of praise and gratitude.</p>
